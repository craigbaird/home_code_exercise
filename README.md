# Home Code Exercise

This repository shows my solution to a code exercise, using bootstrap to create a responsive layout, and using jQuery to collect form data and append it to the DOM

## The Problem
The task was to create a responsive webpage using bootstrap, with items stacking vertically on smaller screens, and some elements sitting inline on larger screens. I was also given form data, asked to build out the rest of the form, and to display the data collected upon hitting a submit button.

## Product Example

Displayed below are three different browser window sizes, which demonstrate how the layout changes responsively to accommodate any screen or device size.

### Small Layout

### Medium Layout
